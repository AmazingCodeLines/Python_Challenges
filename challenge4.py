Challenge 4: Love Score Calculator ðŸ’–

Create a Python program that calculates a "love score" between two individuals based on their names. The program should:

Prompt the user to input their first name and the name of their loved one.
Combine both names and convert them to lowercase.
Count the total occurrences of the letters in the word "TRUE" and the word "LOVE" within the combined names.
Form a score by concatenating the counts of "TRUE" and "LOVE."
Display the love score along with the names provided.
