Challenge 1: FizzBuzz Implementation ðŸŽ¯

Write a Python program that iterates through a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100. For each number, the program should apply the following rules:

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print a specific word.
If the number is divisible only by 3, print another specific word.
If the number is divisible only by 5, print a different word.
If none of the above conditions apply, print the number itself.
