Challenge 12: Build a Simple Calculator ðŸ§®

Create a Python calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. The program should:

Define separate functions for:
Addition: Adds two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides the first number by the second, handling division by zero with an appropriate error message.
Use a dictionary to map mathematical operators (+, -, *, /) to the corresponding functions.
Implement robust input validation:
Prompt the user repeatedly until they provide a valid numeric input.
Ensure the user selects a valid mathematical operation.
Continuously allow calculations until the user chooses to exit:
After displaying each result, ask if the user wants to perform another calculation.
Exit gracefully if the user chooses not to continue.
