Challenge 6-1: Optimized Prime Number Checker ðŸ”¢

Write a Python function that determines whether a given number is a prime number. The function should:

Return False if the number is less than or equal to 1, as these are not prime numbers.
Return True for the prime numbers 2 and 3.
Efficiently eliminate multiples of 2 and 3 early in the process.
Use a loop to check for divisibility by potential factors, optimizing by:
Checking only numbers up to the square root of the given number.
Skipping unnecessary checks by incrementing in steps of 6 (since prime numbers greater than 3 are of the form 6k Â± 1).
